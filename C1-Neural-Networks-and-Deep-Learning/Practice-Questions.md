## Introduction to deep learning

### 8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French?

[x] It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.

[ ] It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

[x] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).

[ ] RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....
  > RNNs are a model type. The iterative process of developing DL systems is a completely separate concept.
