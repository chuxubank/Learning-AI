# Heroes of Deep Learning

## Week 1 | Geoffrey Hinton interview

Geoffrey Hinton's advice to new grad students:

- Find an advisor who has beliefs similar to yours.
  > Because if you work on stuff that your advisor feels deeply about, you'll get a lot of good advice and time from your advisor. If you work on stuff your advisor's not interested in, all you'll get is, you get some advice, but it won't be nearly so useful.

- Read the literature, but don't read too much of it.
  > Most people say you should spend several years reading the literature and then you should start working on your own ideas. And that may be true for some researchers, but for creative researchers I think what you want to do is read a little bit of the literature. And notice something that you think everybody is doing wrong, I'm contrary in that sense. You look at it and it just doesn't feel right. And then figure out how to do it right.

- When people tell you, that's no good, just keep at it.
  > A very good principle for helping people keep at it, which is either your intuitions are good or they're not. If your intuitions are good, you should follow them and you'll eventually be successful. If your intuitions are not good, it doesn't matter what you do.

- Never stop programming.
  > Because if you give a student something to do, if they're botching, they'll come back and say, it didn't work. And the reason it didn't work would be some little decision they made, that they didn't realize is crucial. And if you give it to a good student, like for example. You can give him anything and he'll come back and say, it worked.

- Read enough so you start developing intuitions. And then, trust your intuitions and go for it, don't be too worried if everybody else says it's nonsense.
  > There's no way to know if others are right or wrong when they say it's nonsense, but you just have to go for it, and then find out.
  
  > If you think it's a really good idea, and other people tell you it's complete nonsense, then you know you're really on to something.
